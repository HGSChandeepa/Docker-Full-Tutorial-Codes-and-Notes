## Introduction to Docker

Docker is a platform designed to help developers build, share, and run modern applications. Docker containers enable you to package applications and their dependencies into a standardized unit for software development.

## Download and Install Docker

Follow these steps to download and install Docker on your system:

1. Visit the [Docker download page](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
2. Select your operating system and follow the installation instructions.
3. Verify the installation by running `docker --version` in your terminal.

## Docker Images

A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files.

## Docker Containers

A Docker container is a running instance of a Docker image. Containers are isolated from each other and the host system, ensuring that they behave the same regardless of where they are deployed.

## Parent/Base Images

Parent or base images are the starting point for creating Docker images. They provide the foundation on which your application's dependencies and code are added.

## Docker Hub

Docker Hub is a cloud-based repository where Docker users and partners create, test, store, and distribute container images. You can find images for various software and use them as the basis for your own containers.

## Containerizing a JavaScript Application

Learn how to containerize a simple JavaScript application by following the steps in the tutorial.

## Docker Volumes

Docker volumes are used to persist data generated and used by Docker containers. They are the preferred way to manage data in Docker.

## Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services, and then create and start all the services from your configuration with a single command.

## Projects
